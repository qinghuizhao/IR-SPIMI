SCENE IV	The same. A street.</title>

	[Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
	Disguise us at my lodging and return,
	All in an hour.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	We have not made good preparation.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
	And better in my mind not undertook.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
	To furnish us.

	[Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter]

	Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	An it shall please you to break up
	this, it shall seem to signify.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
	And whiter than the paper it writ on
	Is the fair hand that writ.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Love-news, in faith.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	By your leave, sir.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Whither goest thou?

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
	Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
	I will not fail her; speak it privately.
	Go, gentlemen,

	[Exit Launcelot]

	Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
	I am provided of a torch-bearer.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	And so will I.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	                  Meet me and Gratiano
	At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	'Tis good we do so.

	[Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO]

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
	How I shall take her from her father's house,
	What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
	What page's suit she hath in readiness.
	If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
	It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
	And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
	Unless she do it under this excuse,
	That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
	Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
	Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

SCENE V	The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.</title>

	[Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT]

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
	The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
	What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
	As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
	And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
	Why, Jessica, I say!

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Why, Jessica!

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Your worship was wont to tell me that
	I could do nothing without bidding.

	[Enter Jessica]

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	Call you? what is your will?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
	There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
	I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
	But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
	The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
	Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
	There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
	For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
	your reproach.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	So do I his.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	An they have conspired together, I will not say you
	shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
	for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
	Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
	falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
	year, in the afternoon.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
	Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
	And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
	Clamber not you up to the casements then,
	Nor thrust your head into the public street
	To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
	But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
	Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
	My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
	I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
	But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
	Say I will come.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
	window, for all this, There will come a Christian
	boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

	[Exit]

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
	Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
	More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
	Therefore I part with him, and part with him
	To one that would have him help to waste
	His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
	Perhaps I will return immediately:
	Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
	Fast bind, fast find;
	A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

	[Exit]

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
	I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

SCENE VI	The same.</title>

	[Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued]

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
	Desired us to make stand.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	His hour is almost past.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
	For lovers ever run before the clock.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
	With that keen appetite that he sits down?
	Where is the horse that doth untread again
	His tedious measures with the unbated fire
	That he did pace them first? All things that are,
	Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
	How like a younker or a prodigal
	The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
	Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
	How like the prodigal doth she return,
	With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
	Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

	[Enter LORENZO]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
	Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
	When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
	I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
	Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?

	[Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes]

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Lorenzo, and thy love.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
	For who love I so much? And now who knows
	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
	For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
	But love is blind and lovers cannot see
	The pretty follies that themselves commit;
	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
	To see me thus transformed to a boy.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
	They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
	And I should be obscured.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	So are you, sweet,
	Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
	But come at once;
	For the close night doth play the runaway,
	And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

	[Exit above]

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
	For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
	And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
	And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
	And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
	Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

	[Enter JESSICA, below]

	What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
	Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

	[Exit with Jessica and Salarino]

	[Enter ANTONIO]

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Who's there?

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Signior Antonio!

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
	'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
	No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
	Bassanio presently will go aboard:
	I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
	Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

SCENE VII	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</title>

	[Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the
	PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Go draw aside the curtains and discover
	The several caskets to this noble prince.
	Now make your choice.

<speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>	The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
	The second, silver, which this promise carries,
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
	This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
	How shall I know if I do choose the right?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	The one of them contains my picture, prince:
	If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

<speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>	Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
	I will survey the inscriptions back again.
	What says this leaden casket?
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
	Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
	This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
	Do it in hope of fair advantages:
	A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
	I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
	What says the silver with her virgin hue?
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
	As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
	And weigh thy value with an even hand:
	If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
	Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
	May not extend so far as to the lady:
	And yet to be afeard of my deserving
	Were but a weak disabling of myself.
	As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
	I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
	In graces and in qualities of breeding;
	But more than these, in love I do deserve.
	What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
	Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
	Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
	From the four corners of the earth they come,
	To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
	The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
	Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
	For princes to come view fair Portia:
	The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
	Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
	To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
	As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
	One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
	Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
	To think so base a thought: it were too gross
	To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
	Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
	Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
	O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
	Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
	A coin that bears the figure of an angel
	Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
	But here an angel in a golden bed
	Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
	Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
	Then I am yours.

	[He unlocks the golden casket]

<speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>	                  O hell! what have we here?
	A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
	There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.

	[Reads]

	All that glitters is not gold;
	Often have you heard that told:
	Many a man his life hath sold
	But my outside to behold:
	Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
	Had you been as wise as bold,
	Young in limbs, in judgment old,
	Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
	Fare you well; your suit is cold.
	Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
	Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
	Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
	To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

	[Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
	Let all of his complexion choose me so.

SCENE VIII	Venice. A street.</title>

	[Enter SALARINO and SALANIO]

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
	With him is Gratiano gone along;
	And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
	Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	He came too late, the ship was under sail:
	But there the duke was given to understand
	That in a gondola were seen together
	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
	Besides, Antonio certified the duke
	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	I never heard a passion so confused,
	So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
	As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
	'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
	Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
	Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
	A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
	Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
	And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
	Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
	Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
	Or he shall pay for this.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	Marry, well remember'd.
	I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
	Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
	The French and English, there miscarried
	A vessel of our country richly fraught:
	I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
	And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
	Bassanio told him he would make some speed
	Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
	But stay the very riping of the time;
	And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
	Let it not enter in your mind of love:
	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
	To courtship and such fair ostents of love
	As shall conveniently become you there:'
	And even there, his eye being big with tears,
	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
	And with affection wondrous sensible
	He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

<speaker>SALANIO</speaker>	I think he only loves the world for him.
	I pray thee, let us go and find him out
	And quicken his embraced heaviness
	With some delight or other.

<speaker>SALARINO</speaker>	Do we so.

SCENE IX	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</title>

	[Enter NERISSA with a Servitor]

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
	The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
	And comes to his election presently.

	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,
	PORTIA, and their trains]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
	If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
	Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
	But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
	You must be gone from hence immediately.

<speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>	I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
	First, never to unfold to any one
	Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
	Of the right casket, never in my life
	To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
	If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
	Immediately to leave you and be gone.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	To these injunctions every one doth swear
	That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

<speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>	And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
	To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
	You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
	What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
	What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
	By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
	Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
	Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
	Even in the force and road of casualty.
	I will not choose what many men desire,
	Because I will not jump with common spirits
	And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
	Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
	And well said too; for who shall go about
	To cozen fortune and be honourable
	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
	To wear an undeserved dignity.
	O, that estates, degrees and offices
	Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
	Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
	How many then should cover that stand bare!
	How many be commanded that command!
	How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
	From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
	Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
	To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
	And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

	[He opens the silver casket]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Too long a pause for that which you find there.

<speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>	What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
	Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
	How much unlike art thou to Portia!
	How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
	'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
	Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
	Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
	And of opposed natures.

<speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>	What is here?

	[Reads]

	The fire seven times tried this:
	Seven times tried that judgment is,
	That did never choose amiss.
	Some there be that shadows kiss;
	Such have but a shadow's bliss:
	There be fools alive, I wis,
	Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
	Take what wife you will to bed,
	I will ever be your head:
	So be gone: you are sped.
	Still more fool I shall appear
	By the time I linger here
	With one fool's head I came to woo,
	But I go away with two.
	Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
	Patiently to bear my wroth.

	[Exeunt Arragon and train]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
	O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
	They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	The ancient saying is no heresy,
	Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

	[Enter a Servant]

Servant	Where is my lady?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	                  Here: what would my lord?

Servant	Madam, there is alighted at your gate
	A young Venetian, one that comes before
	To signify the approaching of his lord;
	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
	To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
	So likely an ambassador of love:
	A day in April never came so sweet,
	To show how costly summer was at hand,
	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
	Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
	Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
	Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
	Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
