<title>ACT IV

SCENE I	Venice. A court of justice.</title>

	[Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,
	GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others]

DUKE	What, is Antonio here?

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Ready, so please your grace.

DUKE	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
	uncapable of pity, void and empty
	From any dram of mercy.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I have heard
	Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
	And that no lawful means can carry me
	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
	My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
	To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
	The very tyranny and rage of his.

DUKE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

<speaker>SALERIO</speaker>	He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

	[Enter SHYLOCK]

DUKE	Make room, and let him stand before our face.
	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
	That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
	And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
	But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
	Forgive a moiety of the principal;
	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
	That have of late so huddled on his back,
	Enow to press a royal merchant down
	And pluck commiseration of his state
	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
	To offices of tender courtesy.
	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
	To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
	If you deny it, let the danger light
	Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
	You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
	Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
	But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
	What if my house be troubled with a rat
	And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
	To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
	Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
	And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
	Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
	Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
	As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
	Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
	Must yield to such inevitable shame
	As to offend, himself being offended;
	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
	More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
	A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Do all men kill the things they do not love?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Every offence is not a hate at first.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
	You may as well go stand upon the beach
	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
	You may as well use question with the wolf
	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
	You may as well forbid the mountain pines
	To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
	You may as well do anything most hard,
	As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
	Make no more offers, use no farther means,
	But with all brief and plain conveniency
	Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	What judgment shall I dread, doing
	Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

DUKE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
	You have among you many a purchased slave,
	Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
	You use in abject and in slavish parts,
	Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
	Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
	Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
	Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
	Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
	'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
	The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
	Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
	If you deny me, fie upon your law!
	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?

DUKE	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
	Whom I have sent for to determine this,
	Come here to-day.

<speaker>SALERIO</speaker>	                  My lord, here stays without
	A messenger with letters from the doctor,
	New come from Padua.

DUKE	Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I am a tainted wether of the flock,
	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
	You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
	Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

	[Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk]

DUKE	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.

	[Presenting a letter]

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
	Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
	And for thy life let justice be accused.
	Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
	That souls of animals infuse themselves
	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
	Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
	And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
	Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
	Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
	Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.

DUKE	This letter from Bellario doth commend
	A young and learned doctor to our court.
	Where is he?

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	                  He attendeth here hard by,
	To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

DUKE	With all my heart. Some three or four of you
	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
	Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

Clerk	[Reads]

	Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
	your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
	your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
	me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
	acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
	the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
	many books together: he is furnished with my
	opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
	greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
	with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
	request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
	years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
	estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
	old a head. I leave him to your gracious
	acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
	commendation.

DUKE	You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

	[Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws]

	Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I did, my lord.

DUKE	                  You are welcome: take your place.
	Are you acquainted with the difference
	That holds this present question in the court?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

DUKE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Is your name Shylock?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Shylock is my name.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
	You stand within his danger, do you not?

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Ay, so he says.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	                  Do you confess the bond?

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I do.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	    Then must the Jew be merciful.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
	Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
	'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
	The throned monarch better than his crown;
	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
	The attribute to awe and majesty,
	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
	But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
	It is an attribute to God himself;
	And earthly power doth then show likest God's
	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
	That, in the course of justice, none of us
	Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
	To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
	Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Is he not able to discharge the money?

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
	I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
	If this will not suffice, it must appear
	That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
	Wrest once the law to your authority:
	To do a great right, do a little wrong,
	And curb this cruel devil of his will.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	It must not be; there is no power in Venice
	Can alter a decree established:
	'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
	And many an error by the same example
	Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
	No, not for Venice.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Why, this bond is forfeit;
	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
	Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	When it is paid according to the tenor.
	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
	You know the law, your exposition
	Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
	Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
	There is no power in the tongue of man
	To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Most heartily I do beseech the court
	To give the judgment.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Why then, thus it is:
	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	O noble judge! O excellent young man!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	For the intent and purpose of the law
	Hath full relation to the penalty,
	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Therefore lay bare your bosom.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Ay, his breast:
	So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
	'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
	The flesh?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	         I have them ready.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Is it so nominated in the bond?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	It is not so express'd: but what of that?
	'Twere good you do so much for charity.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
	Than is her custom: it is still her use
	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
	Of such misery doth she cut me off.
	Commend me to your honourable wife:
	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
	Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
	And he repents not that he pays your debt;
	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
	I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Antonio, I am married to a wife
	Which is as dear to me as life itself;
	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
	Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
	Here to this devil, to deliver you.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
	If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
	I would she were in heaven, so she could
	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
	The wish would make else an unquiet house.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
	Would any of the stock of Barrabas
	Had been her husband rather than a Christian!

	[Aside]

	We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
	The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Most rightful judge!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
	The law allows it, and the court awards it.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Tarry a little; there is something else.
	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
	The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
	Unto the state of Venice.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Is that the law?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	                  Thyself shalt see the act:
	For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
	And let the Christian go.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Here is the money.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Soft!
	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
	He shall have nothing but the penalty.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
	Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
	But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
	Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
	Or the division of the twentieth part
	Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
	But in the estimation of a hair,
	Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Give me my principal, and let me go.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	I have it ready for thee; here it is.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	He hath refused it in the open court:
	He shall have merely justice and his bond.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Shall I not have barely my principal?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Why, then the devil give him good of it!
	I'll stay no longer question.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Tarry, Jew:
	The law hath yet another hold on you.
	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
	If it be proved against an alien
	That by direct or indirect attempts
	He seek the life of any citizen,
	The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
	And the offender's life lies in the mercy
	Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
	In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
	For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
	That indirectly and directly too
	Thou hast contrived against the very life
	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
	The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
	Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
	Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.

DUKE	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
	The other half comes to the general state,
	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
	You take my house when you do take the prop
	That doth sustain my house; you take my life
	When you do take the means whereby I live.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	So please my lord the duke and all the court
	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
	I am content; so he will let me have
	The other half in use, to render it,
	Upon his death, unto the gentleman
	That lately stole his daughter:
	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
	He presently become a Christian;
	The other, that he do record a gift,
	Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

DUKE	He shall do this, or else I do recant
	The pardon that I late pronounced here.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I am content.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

<speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
	I am not well: send the deed after me,
	And I will sign it.

DUKE	Get thee gone, but do it.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
	To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

	[Exit SHYLOCK]

DUKE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
	I must away this night toward Padua,
	And it is meet I presently set forth.

DUKE	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

	[Exeunt Duke and his train]

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	And stand indebted, over and above,
	In love and service to you evermore.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	He is well paid that is well satisfied;
	And I, delivering you, am satisfied
	And therein do account myself well paid:
	My mind was never yet more mercenary.
	I pray you, know me when we meet again:
	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
	Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.

	[To ANTONIO]

	Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;

	[To BASSANIO]

	And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
	Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
	And you in love shall not deny me this.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
	I will not shame myself to give you this.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I will have nothing else but only this;
	And now methinks I have a mind to it.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	There's more depends on this than on the value.
	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
	And find it out by proclamation:
	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
	You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
	You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
	And when she put it on, she made me vow
	That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
	An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
	And know how well I have deserved the ring,
	She would not hold out enemy for ever,
	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

	[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa]

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
	Let his deservings and my love withal
	Be valued against your wife's commandment.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
	Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.

	[Exit Gratiano]

	Come, you and I will thither presently;
	And in the morning early will we both
	Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.

	[Exeunt]

<title>ACT IV

SCENE II	The same. A street.</title>

	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
	And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
	And be a day before our husbands home:
	This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

	[Enter GRATIANO]

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
	My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
	Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
	Your company at dinner.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	That cannot be:
	His ring I do accept most thankfully:
	And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
	I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	That will I do.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	                  Sir, I would speak with you.

	[Aside to PORTIA]

	I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
	Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.
	We shall have old swearing
	That they did give the rings away to men;
	But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.

	Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

<title>ACT V

SCENE I	Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.</title>

	[Enter LORENZO and JESSICA]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
	When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
	And they did make no noise, in such a night
	Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
	And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
	Where Cressid lay that night.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	In such a night
	Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
	And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
	And ran dismay'd away.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	In such a night
	Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
	Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
	To come again to Carthage.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	In such a night
	Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
	That did renew old AEson.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	In such a night
	Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
	And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
	As far as Belmont.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	                  In such a night
	Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
	And ne'er a true one.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	In such a night
	Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
	Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	I would out-night you, did no body come;
	But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.

	[Enter STEPHANO]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>	A friend.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?

<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>	Stephano is my name; and I bring word
	My mistress will before the break of day
	Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
	For happy wedlock hours.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Who comes with her?

<speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>	None but a holy hermit and her maid.
	I pray you, is my master yet return'd?

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
	But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
	And ceremoniously let us prepare
	Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

	[Enter LAUNCELOT]

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Who calls?

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
	Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Leave hollaing, man: here.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Sola! where? where?

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Here.

<speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>	Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
	his horn full of good news: my master will be here
	ere morning.

	[Exit]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
	And yet no matter: why should we go in?
	My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
	Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
	And bring your music forth into the air.

	[Exit Stephano]

	How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
	Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
	Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
	Become the touches of sweet harmony.
	Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
	Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
	There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
	But in his motion like an angel sings,
	Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
	Such harmony is in immortal souls;
	But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
	Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

	[Enter Musicians]

	Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
	With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
	And draw her home with music.

	[Music]

<speaker>JESSICA</speaker>	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
	For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
	Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
	Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
	Which is the hot condition of their blood;
	If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
	Or any air of music touch their ears,
	You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
	Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
	By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
	Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
	Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
	But music for the time doth change his nature.
	The man that hath no music in himself,
	Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
	Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
	The motions of his spirit are dull as night
	And his affections dark as Erebus:
	Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	That light we see is burning in my hall.
	How far that little candle throws his beams!
	So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	So doth the greater glory dim the less:
	A substitute shines brightly as a king
	Unto the king be by, and then his state
	Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
	Into the main of waters. Music! hark!

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	It is your music, madam, of the house.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
	Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
	When neither is attended, and I think
	The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
	When every goose is cackling, would be thought
	No better a musician than the wren.
	How many things by season season'd are
	To their right praise and true perfection!
	Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
	And would not be awaked.

	[Music ceases]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	That is the voice,
	Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
	By the bad voice.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	                  Dear lady, welcome home.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
	Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
	Are they return'd?

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	                  Madam, they are not yet;
	But there is come a messenger before,
	To signify their coming.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Go in, Nerissa;
	Give order to my servants that they take
	No note at all of our being absent hence;
	Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.

	[A tucket sounds]

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
	We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
	It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
	Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

	[Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and
	their followers]

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	We should hold day with the Antipodes,
	If you would walk in absence of the sun.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Let me give light, but let me not be light;
	For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
	And never be Bassanio so for me:
	But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
	This is the man, this is Antonio,
	To whom I am so infinitely bound.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	You should in all sense be much bound to him.
	For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	No more than I am well acquitted of.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
	It must appear in other ways than words,
	Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
	In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
	That she did give me, whose posy was
	For all the world like cutler's poetry
	Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	What talk you of the posy or the value?
	You swore to me, when I did give it you,
	That you would wear it till your hour of death
	And that it should lie with you in your grave:
	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
	You should have been respective and have kept it.
	Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
	The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	He will, an if he live to be a man.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
	No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
	A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
	I could not for my heart deny it him.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
	To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
	A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
	And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
	I gave my love a ring and made him swear
	Never to part with it; and here he stands;
	I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
	Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
	That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
	You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
	An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
	And swear I lost the ring defending it.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
	Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
	Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
	That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
	And neither man nor master would take aught
	But the two rings.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	What ring gave you my lord?
	Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	If I could add a lie unto a fault,
	I would deny it; but you see my finger
	Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Even so void is your false heart of truth.
	By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
	Until I see the ring.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Nor I in yours
	Till I again see mine.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Sweet Portia,
	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
	If you did know for whom I gave the ring
	And would conceive for what I gave the ring
	And how unwillingly I left the ring,
	When nought would be accepted but the ring,
	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	If you had known the virtue of the ring,
	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
	Or your own honour to contain the ring,
	You would not then have parted with the ring.
	What man is there so much unreasonable,
	If you had pleased to have defended it
	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
	I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
	And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
	And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
	Even he that did uphold the very life
	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
	I was enforced to send it after him;
	I was beset with shame and courtesy;
	My honour would not let ingratitude
	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
	For, by these blessed candles of the night,
	Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
	And that which you did swear to keep for me,
	I will become as liberal as you;
	I'll not deny him any thing I have,
	No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
	Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
	If you do not, if I be left alone,
	Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
	I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
	How you do leave me to mine own protection.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
	For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
	And, in the hearing of these many friends,
	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
	Wherein I see myself--

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Mark you but that!
	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
	In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
	And there's an oath of credit.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Nay, but hear me:
	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
	I never more will break an oath with thee.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I once did lend my body for his wealth;
	Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
	Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
	Will never more break faith advisedly.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
	And bid him keep it better than the other.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
	For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
	In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Why, this is like the mending of highways
	In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
	What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
	It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
	Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
	And even but now return'd; I have not yet
	Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
	And I have better news in store for you
	Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
	There you shall find three of your argosies
	Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
	You shall not know by what strange accident
	I chanced on this letter.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	I am dumb.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
	Unless he live until he be a man.

<speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
	For here I read for certain that my ships
	Are safely come to road.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	How now, Lorenzo!
	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

<speaker>NERISSA</speaker>	Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
	There do I give to you and Jessica,
	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
	After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.

<speaker>LORENZO</speaker>	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
	Of starved people.

<speaker>PORTIA</speaker>	                  It is almost morning,
	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
	Of these events at full. Let us go in;
	And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
	And we will answer all things faithfully.

<speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>	Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
	Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
	That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
	Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
